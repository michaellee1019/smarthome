Smarthome Dashboard
============================

## Setup and Install

- Buy üçìpi 3 and sd card
    - pi3 is the only one tested for now. Zero W should work with minor tweaks to ansible code, though.
    - don't get a cheap sd card. Pay the extra $5.
	- install heatsink, put in case, plug into wall. Heatsink is apparently necessary.
- Follow [setup steps](./setup.md)
